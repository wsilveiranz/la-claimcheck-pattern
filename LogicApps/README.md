# Instructions

  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "node",
    "APP_KIND": "workflowapp",

    "WORKFLOWS_TENANT_ID": "<your-tenant-id>",
    "WORKFLOWS_SUBSCRIPTION_ID": "<your-subscription-id>",
    "WORKFLOWS_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME": "<your-resource-group-name>",
    "WORKFLOWS_LOCATION_NAME": "<your-location-name>",
    "WORKFLOWS_MANAGEMENT_BASE_URI": "https://management.azure.com/",
    "AzureBlob_connectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<yourblobstorage>;AccountKey=<yourblobstoragekey>;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net",
    "serviceBus_connectionString": "Endpoint=sb://<your-sb-namespace>.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=claim-check-pattern;SharedAccessKey=<your-sb-key>",

## Notes

- The `ProjectDirectoryPath` is the path to the Logic Apps project folder. This is used by the Azure Functions runtime to locate the Logic Apps project.
- The `WORKFLOWS_TENANT_ID`, `WORKFLOWS_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, `WORKFLOWS_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME`, and `WORKFLOWS_LOCATION_NAME` are used to authenticate with Azure Logic Apps.
- The `AzureBlob_connectionString` is the connection string for the Azure Blob Storage account used by the Logic Apps.
- The `serviceBus_connectionString` is the connection string for the Azure Service Bus used by the Logic Apps.
- The `outlook-connectionKey` is the connection key for the Outlook connector used by the Logic Apps. This should be generated by the system if it recognizes an invalid key but only if you have a valid connection created.
- The `outlook-ConnectionRuntimeUrl` is the runtime URL for the Outlook connector used by the Logic Apps. You can find how to retrieve this URL in this [Tech Community blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/integrationsonazureblog/parameterizing-managed-connections-with-logic-apps-standard/3660679).
